# ðŸš€ Task 5 â€“ Kubernetes with Minikube

Just wanted to get my hands dirty with Kubernetes basics. Here's what I did.

## ðŸ›  Tools
- Minikube
- kubectl
- Docker

## âœ… What I Did
- Installed Minikube and started the cluster.
- Wrote a simple Node.js app and built a Docker image inside Minikube.
- Created `deployment.yaml` to deploy the app.
- Created `service.yaml` to expose it using NodePort.
- Verified using `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services`.
- Scaled the app using `kubectl scale`.
- Used `kubectl logs` and `describe` for debugging.

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
Got a solid feel for how Kubernetes deployments, services, and scaling work. Everything ran locally inside Minikube.
